## OWN THE WEB 3 | How to own web space with Handshake(HNS)? How to run a decentalized buisness on top level domains in 2021? Handshake(HNS) is the biggest update to the web/internet ever? We "Shape Reality" by establishing the "I" as the center of gravity. This first of its kind buisness is built on a Handshake(HNS) blockchain root level domain that is dismantling the monopoly in 2021 by Looking Within to the Source, at the root of perception. Handshake helps us resolve self sovereignty by allowing true ownership of authentic web space vs. renting a sub-identity on the internet.
